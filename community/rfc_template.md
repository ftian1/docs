## RFC Title

Format: [RFC] The short description of the feature you want to contribute

## RFC Content

### Author

List all contributors of this RFC. 

### Status

Update the PR status to Proposed / Accepted / Implemented / Obsolete.

### Objective

What are we doing and why? What problem will this solve? What are the goals and
non-goals? This is your executive summary; keep it short, elaborate below.

### Motivation

Why this is a valuable problem to solve? What background information is needed
to show how this design addresses the problem?

Which users are affected by the problem? Why is it a problem? What data supports
this? What related work exists?

### User Benefit

How will users (or other contributors) benefit from this work? What would be the
headline in the release notes or blog post?

### Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If you have
multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the
idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you
have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe
your chosen approach is superior.

Make sure youâ€™ve thought through and addressed the following sections. If a section is not relevant to your specific proposal, please explain why, e.g. your RFC addresses a convention or process, not an API.

### Alternatives Considered
* Make sure to discuss the relative merits of alternatives to your proposal.

### Performance Implications
* Do you expect any (speed / memory)? How will you confirm?
* There should be microbenchmarks. Are there?
* There should be end-to-end tests and benchmarks. If there are not (since this is still a design), how will you track that these will be created?

### Dependencies
* Dependencies: does this proposal add any new dependencies to the project?

### Engineering Impact
* Do you expect changes to binary size / startup time / build time / test times?
* Who will maintain this code? Is this code in its own buildable unit? Can this code be tested in its own? Is visibility suitably restricted to only a small API surface for others to use?

### Platforms and Environments
* Platforms: does this work on all platforms supported by this project? If not, why is that ok? Will it work on embedded/mobile? Does it impact automatic code generation or mobile stripping tooling? Will it work with transformation tools?
* Execution environments (Cloud services, accelerator hardware): what impact do you expect and how will you confirm?

### Compatibility
* Does the design conform to the backwards & forwards compatibility?

### User Impact
* What are the user-facing changes? How will this feature be rolled out?
